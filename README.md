# STUDENT PORTAL

This was the project that I built for a 5 hour hackathon, the question given to us was to build a site where to students can upload their documents for verification, and proctor should be able to view, reject or forward it to next authority.

The application approval process is as follow:
1. Student creates an account and uploads his documents.
2. Proctor verifies them and forwards it to HOD(Head of Department).
3. HOD verifies it and forwards it to Principal.
4. Principal verifies it and forwards it to office, where office after doing final verification closes the application.

This was a fun project because before this project I had no experience in php and javascript, and even if I knew HTML and CSS, my experience was limited to bare minimum. I learnt and improved my skills with these languages within a week before contest.

Languages Used:-
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JAVASCRIPT
4. PHP
5. MYSQL
