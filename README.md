# Student Portal

The Student Portal is a web application designed for streamlining the document verification and approval process within an educational institution. It offers a user-friendly interface for students to submit their documents, and for proctors, HODs (Heads of Department), Principals, and office personnel to efficiently manage the document approval workflow.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Students can create accounts to start the document submission process.
- **Document Upload:** Students can securely upload their documents for verification.
- **Multi-Step Approval:** The application facilitates multi-step approval, where proctors, HODs, Principals, and office personnel sequentially review and approve documents.
- **Document Rejection:** At any stage of the approval process, a user can reject the document, and it will be sent back to the previous reviewer for corrections.
- **Final Verification:** Once documents pass all approval stages, the office personnel perform a final verification before closing the application.
- **User Roles:** Different user roles (students, proctors, HODs, Principals, office personnel) with specific permissions for each role.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP:** Backend development and server-side scripting.
- **MySQL:** Database management system for storing user data and document records.
- **HTML/CSS:** Frontend technologies for creating user interfaces and styling.
- **JavaScript:** Client-side scripting for interactive elements and form validations.
